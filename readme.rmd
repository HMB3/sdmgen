The text and code below summarises a workflow in R that can be used to relatively rapidly assess the environmental range of a species within Australia, from downloading occurrence records, through to creating maps of predicted climatic suitability across Australia at 1km*1km resolution. An example of this work is published in Science of the Total Environment ::

# Background

This code was developed at Macquarie University in Sydney, as part of the 'which plant where' project
(https://www.whichplantwhere.com.au/). The aim was to create a pipeline to rapidly assess the climatic 
suitability of large suites of horticultural plant species under climate change predictions. All over the 
world, local governments are increasing their investment in urban greening interventions, yet there is 
little consideration of whether the current palette of species for these plantings will be resilient to 
climate change. This pipeline was created to assess the distribution of climatically suitable habitat, 
now and in the future, for the tree species most commonly grown by nurseries and planted across Australia's 
urban landscapes. However, it can be used to assess the distribution of any species (e.g. bats, reptiles, etc).

\

# STEP 1 :: Download species occurrence data

\

The backbone of the R workflow is a list of (taxonomically Ridgey-Didge!) species names 
that we supply. The analysis is designed to process data for one species at a time, 
allowing species results to be updated as required. We can demonstrate the workflow 
using a sample of 3 plant species from the Stoten publication above. 

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

## Use the first 3 plant species in the Stoten list
data("plant.spp")
data("bat.spp")
data("insect.spp")
analysis_spp <- str_trim(insect.spp)
analysis_spp <- insect.spp[1:2]
analysis_spp

```


The species list is supplied to a series of functions to calculate enviromnetal ranges and habitat 
suitability. The initial functions download all species records from the Atlas and living Australia
(https://www.ala.org.au/) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, https://www.gbif.org/). 
The species data are downloaded as individual .Rdata files to the specified folders, which must exist first, 
without returning anything.

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## The functions expect these folders,
ALA_dir     <- './data/ALA'
GBIF_dir    <- './data/GBIF'
back_dir    <- './output/maxent/back_sel_models'
full_dir    <- './output/maxent/full_models'
results_dir <- './output/results'
climate_dir <- './data/worldclim/world/2070'
check_dir   <-'./data/GBIF/Check_plots/'
dir_lists   <- c(ALA_dir,  GBIF_dir,    back_dir, check_dir,
                 full_dir, results_dir, climate_dir)

## Create the folders if they don't exist
for(i in dir_lists) {
  if(!dir.exists(i)) {
    message('Creating ', i, ' directory')
    dir.create(i) } else {
      message(i, ' directory already exists')}
}

```

\

Now download GBIF and ALA occurrence data for each species. The downloading functions 
are separated, because the ALA and GBIF columns are slightly different, but both 
data sources are needed to properly quantify species ranges. The package functions 
expect these folders (a typical R project structure), create them if they don't exist

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Download GBIF occurrence data for each species
download_GBIF_all_species(species_list  = analysis_spp,
                          download_path = "./data/GBIF/",
                          download_limit = 20000)

## Download ALA occurrence data for each species
download_ALA_all_species(species_list  = analysis_spp,
                         your_email    = 'hugh.burley@gmail.com',
                         download_path = "./data/ALA/",
                         ala_temp_dir  = 'C:/Users/hughb/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpCmco7x',
                         download_limit = 20000)

``` 

\

# STEP 2 :: Combine species occurrence data

\

This pipeline was developed using worldclim climate raster data, but it can take any set of 
climate rasters. The spatial data used to develop the workflow are on google drive - put this 
folder in your 'data' project folder:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T5ET5MUX3-lkqiN5nNL3SZZagoJlEOal. 

We can also get some global climate data from the worldclim website using raster::getData:

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Download global raster for minimum temperature 
worldclim_climate     <- raster::getData('worldclim', var = 'bio', res = 2.5, path = './data/')
worldclim_annual_temp <- raster::stack("./data/wc2-5/bio1.bil")
sp::plot(worldclim_climate[["bio1"]])

``` 

\

1km worldclim grids for current conditions are also available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mQHVmYxSMw_cw1iGvfU9M7Pq6Kl6nz-C

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Download global raster for minimum temperature
## https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mQHVmYxSMw_cw1iGvfU9M7Pq6Kl6nz-C
worldclim_climate = raster::stack(
  file.path('./data/worldclim/world/current',
            sprintf('bio_%02d', 1:19)))

worldclim_annual_temp <- worldclim_climate[[1]]

```

\

The next function in the workflow combines ALA and GBIF records, filtering them to records on land, 
and recorded after 1950. The climate (i.e. raster) data used can be any worldclim layer. It then trims 
the occurrence records to those inside the raster boundaries (i.e. species records in the ocean
according to the Raster boundaries will be excluded).

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Combine ALA data, and filter to records on land taken > 1950
## The climate data is the worldclim version 1.0
ALA.LAND = combine_ala_records(species_list      = analysis_spp,
                               records_path      = "./data/ALA/",
                               records_extension = "_ALA_records.RData",
                               record_type       = "ALA",
                               keep_cols         = ALA_keep,
                               world_raster      = worldclim_annual_temp)

## Combine GBIF data and filter to records on land taken > 1950
GBIF.LAND = combine_gbif_records(species_list      = analysis_spp,
                                 records_path      = "./data/GBIF/",
                                 records_extension = "_GBIF_records.RData",
                                 record_type       = "GBIF",
                                 keep_cols         = gbif_keep,
                                 world_raster      =  worldclim_annual_temp)

``` 


\

# STEP 3 :: extract environmental values

\

The next step requires a template raster of 1km * 1km cells, which is used to filter 
records to 1 per one 1km cell. This raster needs to have the same extent (global) 
resolution (1km) and projection (WGS84) of the data used to analyse the species 
distributions. It should have a value of 1 for land, and NA for the ocean. 
This takes ages in R.....

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Set the Molleweide projection
sp_epsg54009 <- '+proj=moll +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +towgs84=0,0,0'

## Use gdal to create a template raster in Mollweide
template_raster_1km_mol <- gdalwarp("./data/wc2-5/bio1.bil",
                                    tempfile(fileext = '.bil'),
                                    t_srs = sp_epsg54009,
                                    output_Raster = TRUE,
                                    tr = c(1000, 1000),
                                    r = "near", dstnodata = '-9999')

## Use gdal WGS84 
template_raster_1km_WGS84 <- template_raster_1km_mol %>% 
  projectRaster(., crs = CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))

## Should be 1km*1km, It should have a value of 1 for land, and NA for the ocean
template_raster_1km_WGS84[template_raster_1km_WGS84 > 0] <- 1
template_raster_1km_WGS84[template_raster_1km_WGS84 < 0] <- 1
xres(template_raster_1km_WGS84);projection(template_raster_1km_WGS84)

``` 

\

A pre-prepared template raster is found on google drive:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mQHVmYxSMw_cw1iGvfU9M7Pq6Kl6nz-C

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## This raster has nodata for the ocean, 1 for land, 1km*1Km resolution in WGS84
template_raster_1km_WGS84 = raster("./data/world_koppen/template_1km_WGS84.tif")

```

\

The next function in the workflow combines occurrence files from ALA and GBIF into one table, 
and extracts environmental values. It assumes that both files come from the combine_ala_records 
and combine_gbif_records functions. Note that the order of the raster names in 'world_raster' 
must match the order of names in the character vector 'env_variables'. In this case, it's simply 
the biolclim variables (i.e. bio1-bio19)

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Combine GBIF and ALA data, and extract environmental values
COMBO.RASTER.CONVERT = combine_records_extract(ala_df          = ALA.LAND,
                                               gbif_df         = GBIF.LAND,
                                               urban_df        = 'NONE',
                                               thin_records    = TRUE,
                                               template_raster = template_raster_1km_WGS84,
                                               world_raster    = worldclim_climate,
                                               prj             = CRS("+init=epsg:4326"),
                                               species_list    = analysis_spp,
                                               biocl_vars      = bioclim_variables,
                                               env_vars        = env_variables,
                                               worldclim_grids = TRUE,
                                               save_data       = FALSE,
                                               save_run        = "TEST_BATS")

``` 

\

# STEP 4 :: Automated cleanin' of outlier records

\

The workfow uses four shape-files as part of analysis and mapping: Australia, the World, 
the global Koppen Zones, and the Significant Urban areas of Australia (or SUAs). The SUAs 
are taken from the ABS: https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.004July%202016?OpenDocument.
The Koppen data are from CliMond, centred on 1975: 
https://www.climond.org/Core/Authenticated/KoppenGeiger.aspx

\

The next stage of the workflow use a series of cleaning functions to automate the removal 
of records for each species which are outliers. Doing this manually is extremely tedious, 
and although errors will be made, automation is preferable across large suites of taxa. 
runs a series of cleaning steps. The first cleaning function takes a data frame of all 
species records, and flag records as institutional or spatial outliers. This function 
uses the CoordinateCleaner package: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoordinateCleaner/index.html. It assumes that the 
records data.frame is that returned by the combine_records_extract function.

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Flag records as institutional or spatial outliers
COORD.CLEAN = coord_clean_records(records    = COMBO.RASTER.CONVERT,
                                  capitals   = 10000,  
                                  centroids  = 5000,   
                                  save_run   = "TEST_SPECIES",
                                  save_data  = FALSE)
``` 

\

The next cleaning function takes a data frame of all species records, flags records as 
spatial outliers (T/F for each record in the df), and saves images of the checks for each. 
Manual cleaning of spatial outliers is very tedious, but automated cleaning makes mistakes, 
so checking is handy. This function uses the CoordinateCleaner package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoordinateCleaner/index.html. 
It assumes that the input dfs are those returned by the coord_clean_records function.

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Flag spatial outliers
SPATIAL.CLEAN = check_spatial_outliers(all_df       = COORD.CLEAN,
                                       land_shp     = LAND,
                                       urban_df     = FALSE, 
                                       clean_path   = './data/GBIF/Check_plots/',
                                       spatial_mult = 10,
                                       prj          = CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))
``` 

\

The next cleaning function takes a data frame of all species records, estimates the geographic 
and environmental ranges for each species, and creates a table of all species ranges. 
It uses the AOO.computing function in the ConR package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ConR/index.html
It assumes that the input df is that returned by the check_spatial_outliers function.

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Estimate climate niches using species records
GLOB.NICHE = calc_1km_niches(coord_df     = SPATIAL.CLEAN,
                             prj          = CRS("+init=epsg:4326"),
                             country_shp  = AUS,
                             world_shp    = LAND,
                             kop_shp      = Koppen_shp,
                             species_list = analysis_spp,
                             env_vars     = env_variables,
                             cell_size    = 2,
                             save_run     = "Stoten_EG",
                             data_path    = "./output/results/",
                             save_data    = TRUE)

``` 

\

We can also plot the environmental ranges of each species. The next cleaning function takes 
a data frame of all species records, and plots histograms and convex hulls for 
each species in global environmental space. It assumes that the input df is that 
prepared by the check_spatial_outliers function

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Plot species ranges using histograms and convex hulls for rainfall and temperature distributions
plot_range_histograms(coord_df     = SPATIAL.CLEAN,
                      species_list = analysis_spp,
                      range_path   = check_dir)
``` 

\

# STEP 5 :: Prepare SDM table

\

The final step in the workflow before modelling is to create at table we can use for species distribution modelling. This function takes a data frame of all species records, and prepares a table in the 'species 
with data' (swd) format for modelling uses the Maxent algorithm. It assumes that the input df is that 
returned by the coord_clean_records function. There is a switch in the function, that adds additional 
background points from other taxa, if specified. In this example for bats, we'll just use the species supplied

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Final dataset is a spatial points dataframe in the Mollwiede projection
SDM.SPAT.OCC.BG = prepare_sdm_table(coord_df        = COORD.CLEAN,
                                    species_list    = unique(COORD.CLEAN$searchTaxon),
                                    sdm_table_vars  = sdm_table_vars,
                                    save_run        = "INSECT_EG",
                                    read_background = FALSE,
                                    save_data       = FALSE,
                                    save_shp        = FALSE)

``` 

\

# STEP  6 :: Run Global SDMs

\

The next process is to run species distribution models using global records of each species.
In order to sample species records thoroughly, we use a rasterized version of the 1975 
Koppen raster, and another template raster of the same extent (global), resolution (1km*1km) 
and projection (Mollweide) as the analysis data. This step takes ages...

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Use gdal to create a template raster in the mollweide projection, using one of the bioclim layers
template_raster_1km_mol <- gdalwarp("./data/wc2-5/bio1.bil",
                                    tempfile(fileext = '.bil'),
                                    t_srs = sp_epsg54009,
                                    output_Raster = TRUE,
                                    tr = c(1000, 1000),
                                    r = "near", 
                                    dstnodata = '-9999')

## Should be 1km*1km, values of 0 for ocean and 1 for land 
template_raster_1km_mol[template_raster_1km_mol > 0] <- 1
template_raster_1km_mol[template_raster_1km_mol < 0] <- 1
xres(template_raster_1km_mol)

``` 

\

A pre-prepared template raster in the Mollweide projection is found on google drive :
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mQHVmYxSMw_cw1iGvfU9M7Pq6Kl6nz-C

\


```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Download the template and koppen rasters from google drive
## https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mQHVmYxSMw_cw1iGvfU9M7Pq6Kl6nz-C

Koppen_1975_1km         = raster('data/world_koppen/Koppen_1000m_Mollweide54009.tif')
template_raster_1km_mol = raster("./data/world_koppen/template_has_data_1km.tif")

```

\

The sdm function runs two maxent models: a full model using all variables, and backwards selection. 
Given a candidate set of predictor variables, the backwards selection function identifies a subset 
of variables that meets specified multi-collinearity criteria. Subsequently, backward step-wise variable 
selection is used to iteratively drop the variable that contributes least to the model, 
until the contribution of each variable meets a specified minimum, or until a predetermined 
minimum number of predictors remains.

# STEP 7 :: Project SDMs across Australia

\

The next stage of the process is to project the SDM predictions across geographic space.
First, we need to extract the SDM results from the models. Each model generates a 'threshold' 
of probability of occurrence (see ref), which we use to create map of habitat suitability 
across Australia (). 

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Create a table of maxent results
## This function aggregates the results for models that ran successfully
MAXENT.RESULTS = compile_sdm_results(species_list = analysis_spp[1:3],
                                     results_dir  = 'output/maxent/back_sel_models',
                                     save_data    = FALSE,
                                     data_path    = "./output/results/",
                                     save_run     = "TEST_INSECT")

## Get map_spp from the maxent results table above, change the species column,
## then create a list of logistic thresholds
map_spp         <- MAXENT.RESULTS$searchTaxon %>% gsub(" ", "_", .,)
percent.10.log  <- MAXENT.RESULTS$Logistic_threshold
sdm.results.dir <- MAXENT.RESULTS$results_dir

``` 

\

Now we need some future climate projections. We can download raster Worldclim data using the raster package.
The Stoten publication uses climate projections under six global circulation models (create a table here) :

\


```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## List of scenarios that we used in the Stoten article
scen_list <- c('AC', 'CC', 'HG', 'GF', 'MC', 'NO')

## For all the scenarios in the list
for(scen in scen_list)
  
## Download each to the specified folder, for EG 2070   
message('Get the worldclim data for ', scen)
raster::getData('CMIP5', 
                var   = 'bio', 
                res   = 2.5, 
                rcp   = 85, 
                model = scen, 
                year  = 70,
                path = './data/worldclim/world/2070')

``` 

\

Or, we can load in some 1km*1km Worldclim rasters for current environmental conditions :

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## 1km*1km Worldclim rasters for current environmental conditions can be found here:
## https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B14Jdv_NK2iWnmsqCxlKcEXkKIqwmRL_
aus.grids.current <- stack(
  file.path('./data/worldclim/aus/current', 
            sprintf('bio_%02d.tif', 1:19)))

``` 

\

The projection function takes the maxent models created by the 'fit_maxent_targ_bg_back_sel' function, 
and projects the models across geographic space - currently just for Australia. It uses the rmaxent package https://github.com/johnbaums/rmaxent. It assumes that the maxent models were generated by the 'fit_maxent_targ_bg_back_sel'function.
Note that this step is quite memory heavy, and is best run with 32GB of RAM.

\

```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Create a local projection for mapping : Australian Albers
gc()
aus_albers <- CRS('+proj=aea +lat_1=-18 +lat_2=-36 +lat_0=0 +lon_0=132 +x_0=0 +y_0=0

                            current_grids = aus.grids.current,

  error = function(cond) {
    
    ## This will write the error message inside the text file, but it won't include the species

    cat(cond$message, file = file.path("output/maxent/back_sel_models/mapping_failed_2070.txt"))
    warning(cond$message)
    
  })

**Figure 2.** Example of a continuous climatic suitability map for one plant species under 
current conditions. Species occurrence points are plotted in red on the left panel. The cells in the right 
panel are coded from 0 : no to low suitability, to 1 : highly suitable. The shaded areas on the right panel
indicate where the maxent model is extrapolating beyond the training data (i.e. the result of a MESS map).

# STEP 8 :: Aggregate SDM projections within Spatial units

\

Now that all the species models and projections have been run, we need to aggregate them 
across all six global circulation models. In order to aggregate the results, we need 
a shapefile to aggregate to. In this example, we'll use the Australian Significant Urban 
Areas, which were used in the Stoten article. A geo-tif of the Significant Areas is on 
Google drive:

\


```{r message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## Can't use the .rda, must use the file path
areal_unit_vec <- shapefile_vector_from_raster(shp_file = SUA,
                                               prj      = CRS("+init=EPSG:3577"),
                                               agg_var  = 'SUA_CODE16',
                                               temp_ras = aus.grids.current[[1]],
                                               targ_ras = './data/SUA_2016_AUST.tif')

## This is a vector of all the cells that either are or aren't in the rasterized shapefile
summary(areal_unit_vec)

``` 

\

This aggregation function uses the 10th% Logistic threshold for each species 
from the maxent models to threshold the rasters of habitat suitability (0-1) 
For each GCM. For each species, it sums the 6 GCMS to create a binary raster with 
cell values between 0-6. These cell values represent the number of GCMs where that 
cell had a suitability value above the threshold determined by maxent. We classify 
a cell has suitable if it met the threshold in > 4 GCMs, and use this combined 
raster to compare current and future suitability, measuring if the suitability 
of each cell is changing over time, remaining stable or was never suitable
It assumes that the maxent predictions were generated by the 'project_maxent_grids_mess'  
function. Note that this step is quite memory heavy, and is best run with 32GB of RAM.

\

                write_rasters = TRUE),
         
         ## If the species fails, write a fail message to file.
         error = function(cond) {
           
           ## This will write the error message inside the text file,
           file.create(file.path("output/maxent/back_sel_models/sua_count_failed_2030.txt"))
